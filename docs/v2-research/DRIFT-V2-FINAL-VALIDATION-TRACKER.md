# Drift V2 — Final Validation Tracker (Round 2)

> Purpose: Identify and validate everything in DRIFT-V2-IMPLEMENTATION-ORCHESTRATION.md
> that was NOT covered by the first 8 research sections. The first round validated
> technical decisions (crate versions, algorithms, architecture patterns). This round
> validates the orchestration-level decisions: build ordering, estimates, dependencies,
> verification gates, risk mitigations, and the 29 revisions from the audit synthesis.
>
> Method: One section per agent context window. Agent reads this tracker + the
> orchestration plan section + the AUDIT-SYNTHESIS-AND-REMAINING-WORK.md revisions
> that apply to its section. Agent produces a SECTION-9-FINDINGS.md (etc.) with
> verdicts per item. Each section is marked DONE when complete.
>
> Source truth: DRIFT-V2-IMPLEMENTATION-ORCHESTRATION.md (the plan being validated)
> Revisions to apply: AUDIT-SYNTHESIS-AND-REMAINING-WORK.md (29 revisions from Round 1)
> Reference: SECTION-1-FINDINGS.md through SECTION-8-FINDINGS.md (Round 1 results)

## What Round 1 Covered vs What It Didn't

### Round 1 (Sections 1-8) Validated:
- ✅ Crate dependency versions (all 17 workspace deps audited)
- ✅ Algorithm choices (Bayesian, Tarjan, MinHash, taint, etc.)
- ✅ Architecture patterns (visitor, singleton, batch writer, etc.)
- ✅ Library selections (petgraph, moka, lasso, statrs, etc.)
- ✅ Per-system technical design (all 35 specced systems reviewed)
- ✅ Open Decisions OD-1 through OD-5 (all resolved)

### Round 1 Did NOT Validate:
- ❌ Orchestration §1: Governing principles (D1-D7, AD1-AD12) — referenced but not audited for completeness
- ❌ Orchestration §2: 60-System Master Registry — system count, categorization, phase assignments
- ❌ Orchestration §3-13: Phase-level build estimates, verification gates, build ordering safety
- ❌ Orchestration §9.2/§9.4: Rules Engine + Policy Engine detailed design (no V2-PREP)
- ❌ Orchestration §14: Cross-Phase Dependency Matrix — edge correctness, missing edges
- ❌ Orchestration §15: Parallelization Map — false parallelism, critical path accuracy
- ❌ Orchestration §16: Risk Register R1-R16 — completeness, mitigation adequacy
- ❌ Orchestration §17: Unspecced Systems — timing, scope, risk of deferral
- ❌ Orchestration §18: Cortex Pattern Reuse Guide — factual accuracy against current codebase
- ❌ Orchestration §18.1-18.3: Performance targets, schema progression, NAPI counts — reconciliation
- ❌ Orchestration §19: Verification Gates — testability, completeness, measurability
- ❌ Orchestration §20: Gap Analysis §20.1-20.17 — resolution status of all 17 gaps
- ❌ Application of the 29 revisions identified in Round 1
- ❌ The 9 unspecced systems — scope definition, risk, when-to-spec accuracy
- ❌ Phase 10 systems (Licensing, Docker, Telemetry, IDE, AI Providers, CIBench) — no deep review
- ❌ Hybrid Rust/TS architecture decisions (Simulation, Decision Mining, MCP, CLI)

## How to Use This Document

**At the start of each agent session, paste this prompt:**

```
I'm doing a FINAL validation of the Drift V2 implementation orchestration plan.
This is Round 2 — Round 1 validated technical decisions (algorithms, crate versions,
architecture). This round validates orchestration-level decisions: build ordering,
estimates, dependencies, verification gates, and applies the 29 revisions from Round 1.

Read #File docs/v2-research/DRIFT-V2-FINAL-VALIDATION-TRACKER.md to see what's
been completed and what's next. Then read the specific orchestration plan sections
and reference files listed for your section.

For each item produce one of:
- ✅ CONFIRMED — decision is sound, ordering is safe, estimate is realistic
- ⚠️ REVISE — needs adjustment (provide specific revision)
- ❌ REJECT — decision is wrong or unsafe (provide alternative)
- 🔧 APPLIED — revision from Round 1 has been verified and documented

Write your findings to the appropriate SECTION-X-FINDINGS.md file.
Mark the section DONE before stopping. Do NOT move to the next section.
```
