    description: `Get curated context for a specific task. This is the RECOMMENDED STARTING POINT for any code generation task.

Instead of calling multiple tools and synthesizing results yourself, tell drift_context what you're trying to do and it will return everything you need:
- Relevant patterns with examples
- Files you'll likely need to modify  
- Guidance on how to approach the task
- Warnings about potential issues
- Confidence signals so you know when to verify

WHEN TO USE:
- Starting any code generation task
- Before making changes to unfamiliar code
- When you need to understand how something is done in this codebase

MULTI-PROJECT SUPPORT:
- Use the optional "project" parameter to target a specific registered project
- Projects are registered via "drift projects add <path>"
- Use drift_projects action="list" to see available projects

EXAMPLE:
  intent: "add_feature", focus: "user authentication"
  → Returns auth patterns, example code, files to modify, security warnings
  
  intent: "fix_bug", focus: "payment", project: "backend"
  → Returns context from the "backend" project specifically`,

- add_feature: Adding new functionality
- fix_bug: Fixing a bug or issue
- refactor: Improving code structure without changing behavior

- understand_code: Learning how something works
